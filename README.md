# Java-Programming
What is Java? 
In essence, Java is 2 things. First, Java may be a programming and computing platform. Sun Microsystems first released it in 1995. Today, it's widely utilized in a spread of various websites. In fact, numerous applications and websites simply won't run unless you have got Java installed.

Java is easier to use than other programming languages, like C++, partially because it uses an object-oriented programming model. In object-oriented programming, concepts are represented as “objects” that have data fields and associated methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract project. Although, they're assembled independently of 1 another, all of those objects together form a full piece of software. In Java, these “objects” are a part of “classes” and that they inherit the code common to the category. Object-oriented programming presents variety of various advantages. specifically, it reduces the likelihood of great errors in codes. It also makes it easier to switch and maintain existing code. Overall, this code use and code recycling makes coding rather more efficient.

In addition to a programming and computer platform, Java is additionally a program, or a “run-time environment” that you just can install on any computer, smartphone, or mobile device so as to run Java-based applications.

# How is Java Used?

In today’s world, Java has a vast variety of different uses. For example, Java is used for web-applications like Google docs, as well as for things like mobile games. Perhaps most notably, Java is widely used to build small application modules or applets for use as part of a web page. Basically, developers use it to create applications on your computer.
